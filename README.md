## My process
  I sloved this challenge by first laying out the elements using HTML
  then I applied the style, and made it responsive for mobile screens.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

I got to learn how to align elements horizontally and vertically simultaneously using the "display flex" property. also learnt where to apply the "flex-direction" property.


### Useful resources

- [resource 1](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-center-anything-with-css-align-a-div-text-and-more/) - This helped me to understand how to align elements using css. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [resource 2](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_mediaqueries.asp) - This is an amazing article which helped me with making the webpage responsive. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
